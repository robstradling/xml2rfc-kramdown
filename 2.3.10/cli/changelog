xml2rfc (2.3.10) ietf; urgency=low

  * Changed the output text for Internet-Draft references to omit the 
    series name, but add (work in progress).  Updated the test case to match 
    draft revision number.

  * Updated all the rfc editor boilerplate in valid test facits to match the 
    correct outcome (which is also what the code actually produces).

  * Changed the diff test error message so that the valid text is output as 
    the original, not as the changed text of a diff.

  * Corrected test cases to match correct expiry using 185 days instead of 
    183 days from document date.

  * Added missing attributes to the XmlRfcError Exception subclass, 
    necessary in order to make it resemble lxml's error class and provide 
    consistent error messages to the user whether they come from lxml or our 
    own code.

  * Added a licence file, indicating the licencing used by the IETF for the 
    xml2rfc code.

  * Fixed up the xml2rfc cli script to provide better help texts by telling 
    the option parser the appropriate option variable names.

  * Fixed up the help text formatting by explicitly providing an appropriate
    help text formatter to the option parser.  

  * Added an option (--date=DATE)to provide the document date on the command
    line.

  * Added an option (--no-dtd) to disable the DTD validation step.  

  * Added code to catch additional exceptions and provide appropriate user
    information, instead of an exception traceback.
